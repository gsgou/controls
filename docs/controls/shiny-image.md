# ShinyImage

[← All Shiny Controls](../../README.md)

A remote image that always shows *something* — placeholder artwork, a loading ring, the image, or
error artwork — with the download itself under your control on MAUI. On MAUI it also renders **SVG**,
as vectors rather than as a rasterized bitmap.

<!-- TODO: capture screenshots for shiny-image -->

```xml
<shiny:ShinyImage Uri="{Binding PhotoUrl}"
                  PlaceholderImage="placeholder.png"
                  ErrorImage="broken_image.png"
                  Aspect="AspectFill"
                  HeightRequest="220" />
```

```razor
<ShinyImage Uri="@PhotoUrl"
            PlaceholderUri="/images/placeholder.svg"
            Alt="Profile photo"
            ObjectFit="cover" />
```

**The loading ring picks its own mode.** When the response carries a `Content-Length` the ring fills
to a real percentage; when it does not — a chunked response, or a request still waiting for a
download slot — the same ring spins instead. There is nothing to configure: `Percent` is null in
exactly the cases where a percentage would be a lie.

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Uri | string? | The image to load. `http`/`https` goes through `IImageService`; `resource://` reads an embedded resource; `data:` is decoded inline; anything else is a file path or bundled asset |
| Source | ImageSource? | An explicit source (MAUI). Takes precedence over `Uri` and skips the service entirely |
| PlaceholderImage / PlaceholderUri | ImageSource? / string? | Artwork shown before and during the load, **behind** the ring |
| ErrorImage / ErrorUri | ImageSource? / string? | Artwork shown when the load fails |
| LoadingTemplate / LoadingContent | DataTemplate? / RenderFragment&lt;ImageLoadProgress&gt;? | Replaces the ring entirely; context is the live progress |
| ErrorTemplate / ErrorContent | DataTemplate? / RenderFragment&lt;ImageLoadProgress&gt;? | Replaces the error artwork |
| Aspect / ObjectFit | Aspect / string | How the image scales (default `AspectFit` / `contain`) |
| FadeInDuration | uint / int | Fade-in milliseconds once loaded (default 150) |
| RingSize, RingColor, RingTrackColor, ProgressTextColor, ShowProgressText | — | Ring appearance; colours fall back to theme tokens |
| CacheEnabled, CacheDuration | bool, TimeSpan? | Per-image cache participation and expiry override (MAUI) |
| DisableProgress | bool | Blazor: skip the streamed fetch and let the browser load the URL directly |
| State, Progress, IsLoading, LoadError | read-only | The live load state |
| ImageLoaded / ImageFailed | event / EventCallback | Completion callbacks (plus `ImageLoadedCommand` / `ImageFailedCommand` on MAUI) |
| SvgTintColor | Color? | MAUI: what `currentColor` resolves to in an SVG. Ignored by rasters and by artwork with its own colours |
| ReloadAsync() | method | Re-fetch, skipping the cache — and, for SVG, re-parse |

## SVG (MAUI)

SVG is drawn rather than rasterized: one file stays sharp at every size, and a single-colour icon can
be tinted per placement. The format is detected from the payload, not the file extension, so an
endpoint that serves vectors from a URL that does not say so still works.

```xml
<!-- an embedded resource, tinted from the theme -->
<shiny:ShinyImage Uri="resource://MyApp.Assets.logo.svg"
                  SvgTintColor="{StaticResource Primary}"
                  HeightRequest="48" />

<!-- a file on disk, a bundled asset, or a remote URL - all the same property -->
<shiny:ShinyImage Uri="/var/mobile/.../chart.svg" />
<shiny:ShinyImage Uri="art/logo.svg" />
<shiny:ShinyImage Uri="https://cdn.example.com/logo.svg" />
```

`resource://Name` searches the app assembly, then the entry assembly, then everything loaded, matching
the manifest name exactly and then by suffix — so `resource://Assets.logo.svg` finds
`MyApp.Assets.logo.svg`. Write `resource://MyLib/MyLib.Assets.logo.svg` to name the assembly outright.

**Parsing is cached, not just the bytes.** `IImageService` already stops the same URL being downloaded
twice, but turning bytes into geometry is an XML parse, a path-data parse per shape and a bounds
measurement per shape — pure CPU on the UI thread, repeated for every cell in a list showing the same
icon. Parsed documents are immutable and shared through an LRU `SvgCache`, so a hundred rows showing
one icon parse it once. `SvgTintColor` is applied at draw time rather than baked in, so placements
that disagree about the colour still share a parse.

```csharp
builder.UseShinyControls(cfg => cfg.ConfigureImages(o => o.SvgCacheEntryLimit = 32));
```

**What is drawn:** `path`, `rect`, `circle`, `ellipse`, `line`, `polyline`, `polygon`, `text`, `g`,
`use`, `symbol`, `defs`, `switch`, `clipPath`, linear and radial gradients, presentation attributes,
the `style` attribute, and the type/class/id rules inside a `<style>` element — which is how
Illustrator, Figma and Sketch export shared appearance. `.svgz` is decompressed transparently.

**What is not:** filters, masks, patterns, markers, embedded raster `<image>`, SMIL and CSS animation,
and external references of any kind (an image file never becomes a fetch). An unsupported element is
skipped rather than approximated, so it costs that element and nothing else. Gradient strokes fall
back to their first stop — `ICanvas` fills with a paint but strokes with a colour.

Blazor needs none of this: the browser renders SVG natively through `<img>`.

## ImageService (MAUI)

Downloads go through `IImageService`, which caches to memory and disk, caps concurrency, and
collapses concurrent requests for the same URI into a single download — the difference between a
scrolling list issuing one request per unique image and one per visible cell.

```csharp
builder.UseShinyControls(cfg => cfg
    .ConfigureImages(o =>
    {
        o.MaxConcurrentDownloads = 4;                 // requests past this report Queued
        o.DiskCacheDuration      = TimeSpan.FromDays(7);
        o.MaxDiskCacheBytes      = 100 * 1024 * 1024; // LRU-trimmed
        o.MemoryCacheEnabled     = true;
        o.MaxMemoryCacheBytes    = 32 * 1024 * 1024;
        o.MaxMemoryItemBytes     = 2 * 1024 * 1024;   // bigger images stay disk-only
        o.SvgCacheEntryLimit     = 32;                // parsed SVG documents kept
    })
);
```

```csharp
// Clear cached images — e.g. from a "free up space" setting
await imageService.ClearCacheAsync();
await imageService.ClearCacheAsync(oneUrl);
var bytes = await imageService.GetCacheSizeAsync();
await imageService.PrefetchAsync(nextPageUrls);
```

**Bring your own `HttpClient`.** For authenticated images — the one thing a plain `Image` or `<img>`
genuinely cannot do — replace `IImageDownloader`, not the whole service. Caching, queueing and
de-duplication stay where they are:

```csharp
class AuthenticatedDownloader(HttpClient client, ITokenStore tokens) : IImageDownloader
{
    public async Task<ImageDownloadResult> DownloadAsync(ImageRequest request, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var msg = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, request.Uri);
        msg.Headers.Authorization = new("Bearer", await tokens.GetAsync(ct));

        var response = await client.SendAsync(msg, HttpCompletionOption.ResponseHeadersRead, ct);
        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();

        return new ImageDownloadResult(
            await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync(ct),
            response.Content.Headers.ContentLength   // this is what makes the ring determinate
        );
    }
}

// builder.UseShinyControls(cfg => cfg.SetCustomImageDownloader<AuthenticatedDownloader>());
// cfg.SetCustomImageService<T>() replaces the whole pipeline, caching included.
```

The memory tier caches **encoded bytes, not `ImageSource` objects** — a stream-backed `ImageSource`
is consumed once and platform image handles are bound to the view that realized them, so sharing one
across cells renders blank. Each control builds a fresh `ImageSource.FromStream` from the cached
bytes, which is free; the network round-trip is what was skipped.

## Blazor

There is no cache layer on Blazor and that is deliberate — the browser already has a well-tuned HTTP
cache, shared across tabs and persisted between sessions. What Blazor *does* add is progress:
`ShinyImage` streams remote images through `fetch` and a `ReadableStream` reader so the ring can show
a genuine percentage, which no `<img>` element can report.

> **CORS caveat.** A plain `<img>` may load a cross-origin image with no server cooperation; `fetch`
> may not. When the streamed load is blocked, the component silently falls back to letting the
> browser load the URL directly — the image still appears, the ring just stays indeterminate. Set
> `DisableProgress="true"` to take that path deliberately.

For authenticated images, register a downloader:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddShinyImages();                          // uses the registered HttpClient
builder.Services.AddShinyImages<AuthenticatedDownloader>(); // or your own
```
