# Walkthrough

[← All Shiny Controls](../../README.md)

A guided tour of a page on both hosts: dim everything, cut an animated spotlight around one control at a
time, and say what it does. Onboarding, feature announcements, and workflows people only do once a quarter.

The steps are declared **together on the walkthrough, in order** — not attached to the controls they
describe. That is the point of the control. On a real screen (nested layouts, templated cells, a control
that is only sometimes there) attached ordering scatters the sequence across the markup where nothing can
see it as a whole: reordering means hunting, and a step whose control is conditionally hidden derails the
rest silently. Here reordering is moving a line, and `IsVisible="False"` takes a step out of the run and
re-numbers the counter.

The tour paints into a layer above the page's content, so a target inside a scroll view or a card is
highlighted **where it actually is** rather than clipped by its container.

A step advances **three ways**, which compose per step:

1. **The Next command** — the built-in nav row, or `NextCommand` / `NextAsync()` on your own button.
2. **Using the highlighted control** — `AdvanceOnTargetTap` (MAUI) / `AdvanceOnTargetClick` (Blazor). This
   is "tap Save to continue"; it implies target interaction, since the tap has to reach the control.
3. **A timer** — the step's `Duration` in milliseconds. Zero (the default) waits for the user.

Four displays: **`Popover`** (card, tail, counter and Back/Next/Skip — the default), **`Tooltip`**
(compact, no buttons), **`Inline`** (card without a tail, beside the target), and **`Spotlight`** (no card
at all — the text sits on the dim and the cut-out does the pointing). Or replace the body entirely with
`Content` / `ContentTemplate`.

`RememberRunKey` is what makes onboarding onboarding: the tour runs once per user and then stays out of the
way. It is backed by a replaceable `IWalkthroughStore` — `Preferences` on MAUI, `localStorage` on Blazor —
so the flag can live with the rest of your user state instead. `Restart()` clears it and runs again, which
is the "show me the tour again" menu item.

```xml
<shiny:Walkthrough x:Name="Tour"
                   RememberRunKey="home-v1"
                   AutoStart="True"
                   UseOverlay="True"
                   OverlayOpacity="0.8">

    <!-- No target: a centred welcome card, no cut-out. -->
    <shiny:WalkthroughStep Title="Welcome" Text="Here is what is new." AnimationIn="Pop" />

    <shiny:WalkthroughStep Target="{x:Reference SearchBox}"
                           Title="Find anything"
                           Text="Search across every project you can see."
                           Placement="Bottom" />

    <!-- No card; the cut-out does the pointing. -->
    <shiny:WalkthroughStep Target="{x:Reference Avatar}"
                           Title="Your profile"
                           Display="Spotlight" Highlight="Circle" />

    <!-- Live control: the tap reaches it through the hole, and using it advances. -->
    <shiny:WalkthroughStep Target="{x:Reference SaveButton}"
                           Text="Press Save to finish."
                           AllowTargetInteraction="True"
                           AdvanceOnTargetTap="True" />
</shiny:Walkthrough>
```

```razor
<Walkthrough @ref="tour" RememberRunKey="home-v1" AutoStart="true">
    <Steps>
        <WalkthroughStep Title="Welcome" Text="Here is what is new." />
        <WalkthroughStep Target="#search" Title="Find anything" Text="Search everything."
                         Placement="TooltipPlacement.Bottom" />
        <WalkthroughStep Target="#avatar" Title="Your profile"
                         Display="WalkthroughDisplay.Spotlight"
                         Highlight="WalkthroughHighlight.Circle" />
        <WalkthroughStep Target="#save" Text="Press Save to finish."
                         AllowTargetInteraction="true" AdvanceOnTargetClick="true" />
    </Steps>
</Walkthrough>
```

Targets are `{x:Reference}` on MAUI — prefer it, because it is checked when the XAML compiles, so a renamed
control breaks the build instead of quietly producing a tour that highlights nothing — or a CSS selector on
Blazor. `Walkthrough` renders nothing where it sits, so put it anywhere on the page. Blazor adds keyboard
navigation (arrows and Enter move, Escape leaves) and a scroll lock, both on by default; register the
`localStorage` store with `builder.Services.AddShinyWalkthrough()`.

`AllowTargetInteraction` is implemented by fencing the backdrop with four transparent panels *around* the
cut-out rather than one full-screen catcher — hit testing has no notion of a hole, so the hole has to be a
gap between panels.
