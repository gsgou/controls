# Tooltip

[← All Shiny Controls](../../README.md)

The bubble the walkthrough is built on, usable on its own. It either **wraps** the thing it describes or
**points at** something else, and it is drawn in a page-level layer (MAUI) or the browser's top layer
(Blazor) — so it is never clipped by the scroll view, card or grid cell its target lives in, and never
loses a z-index argument.

```xml
<!-- Wrapping: no reference needed, and the wrapper does not disturb the layout. -->
<shiny:Tooltip Text="Saves without closing" Placement="Top" Trigger="LongPress">
    <Button Text="Apply" />
</shiny:Tooltip>

<!-- Anchored and bound: it does not have to sit near its target in the markup. -->
<shiny:Tooltip Target="{x:Reference SaveButton}"
               Title="Why is this disabled?"
               Text="Make a change first."
               Placement="Bottom"
               ShowTail="True"
               IsOpen="{Binding ShowSaveHint}"
               Command="{Binding DismissHint}" />

<!-- The attached shorthand, for places an element does not fit. -->
<Button Text="Sync" shiny:TooltipProperties.Text="Pushes local changes to the server" />
```

```razor
<Tooltip Text="Saves without closing" Placement="TooltipPlacement.Top">
    <ShinyButton Text="Apply" />
</Tooltip>

<Tooltip Target="#save" Title="Why is this disabled?" Text="Make a change first."
         Trigger="TooltipTrigger.Manual" @bind-IsOpen="showHint" />
```

Bind **`IsOpen`**, never `IsVisible` — that one is `VisualElement.IsVisible`, and setting it would hide the
anchor the tooltip is wrapping rather than the bubble.

`Placement` is a preference, not a promise: a side with no room flips to its opposite, then to the roomiest
of the four; the bubble is clamped to stay inside `ScreenMargin`; and the tail slides along the bubble's
edge to keep pointing at the target it was clamped away from, pulled in from the corners so it always meets
a straight edge. So `Placement="Left"` on a control hard against the left edge gives you a bubble on the
right, deliberately.

Triggers are `Manual` / `Tap` / `LongPress` / `Hover` / `Focus` on MAUI, and `Manual` / `Hover` / `Click` /
`Focus` / `HoverOrFocus` (the default) / `LongPress` on Blazor — `HoverOrFocus` being the accessible one,
since a hover-only tooltip is unreachable by keyboard.
