# Scheduler

[← All Shiny Controls](../../README.md)

Calendar and agenda views for displaying events and appointments, powered by `ISchedulerEventProvider`.

| Calendar | Agenda | Event List |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|

**SchedulerCalendarView** - Month calendar grid with event indicators, swipe navigation, and date selection.

```xml
<shiny:SchedulerCalendarView
    Provider="{Binding Provider}"
    SelectedDate="{Binding SelectedDate}"
    DisplayMonth="{Binding DisplayMonth}" />
```

**SchedulerAgendaView** - Day/multi-day timeline with time slots, overlapping event layout, current time marker, optional timezone columns, and switchable date picker modes (carousel, calendar sheet, or none).

```xml
<shiny:SchedulerAgendaView
    Provider="{Binding Provider}"
    SelectedDate="{Binding SelectedDate}"
    DaysToShow="{Binding DaysToShow}"
    DatePickerMode="Calendar"
    ShowAdditionalTimezones="{Binding ShowAdditionalTimezones}" />
```

**DatePickerMode** options: `Carousel` (default horizontal day picker), `Calendar` (collapsible month calendar with pull-to-expand), `None` (no picker).

**Drag & drop event editing** (agenda timeline only) - drag an event to a new time, across day columns when `DaysToShow > 1`, or drag its top/bottom grip to change its duration. Off by default and additive: with `AllowEventDrag`/`AllowEventResize` unset, no gesture recognizers are attached (MAUI), no JS module is imported (Blazor), and the rendered tree is unchanged.

```xml
<shiny:SchedulerAgendaView
    Provider="{Binding Provider}"
    AllowEventDrag="True"
    AllowEventResize="True"
    DragSnapMinutes="15"
    MinEventDuration="00:15:00"
    AllowCrossDayDrag="True" />
```

| Property | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AllowEventDrag` | `false` | Move an event to a new time (and, when `DaysToShow > 1`, another day). |
| `AllowEventResize` | `false` | Drag the top/bottom edge to change duration. |
| `DragSnapMinutes` | `15` | Snap granularity, clamped to 1-60. |
| `MinEventDuration` | 15 min | Resize floor. A move never changes duration. |
| `DragActivationDelay` | 350 ms | Long-press arming delay for touch; mouse never waits. `Zero` arms immediately. |
| `AllowCrossDayDrag` | `true` | Only meaningful when `DaysToShow > 1`. |
| `DragSnapGuideColor` | separator colour | The guide line drawn at the snapped position. |

On touch the drag arms on a long press, so a vertical swipe still scrolls the timeline; with a mouse it starts immediately. The long press is measured from the touch itself, and arming disables the enclosing scroller natively for that one gesture — a press that arms and then never moves is still a tap, and still selects the event. The change is committed optimistically and reverted if the provider says no. All-day events are not draggable, and timed ↔ all-day conversion is not supported.

**SchedulerCalendarListView** - Scrollable event list grouped by day with infinite scroll loading and sticky day headers (`StickyDayHeaders`, on by default, pins the current day's header to the top while scrolling).

```xml
<shiny:SchedulerCalendarListView
    Provider="{Binding Provider}"
    SelectedDate="{Binding SelectedDate}" />
```

The Blazor `SchedulerAgendaView` has the same feature set — `DaysToShow` (1–7 day columns), `DatePickerMode` (`Carousel` / `Calendar` / `None`), `ShowAdditionalTimezones` + `AdditionalTimezones` side-by-side timezone columns, overlap-aware event layout, and an auto-updating current time marker — using CSS color strings instead of `Color`.

**ISchedulerEventProvider** - Implement this interface to supply event data:

```csharp
public class MyEventProvider : ISchedulerEventProvider
{
    public Task<IReadOnlyList<SchedulerEvent>> GetEvents(DateTimeOffset start, DateTimeOffset end) { ... }
    public void OnEventSelected(SchedulerEvent selectedEvent) { ... }
    public bool CanCalendarSelect(DateOnly selectedDate) => true;
    public void OnCalendarDateSelected(DateOnly selectedDate) { }
    public bool CanSelectAgendaTime(DateTimeOffset selectedTime) => true;
    public void OnAgendaTimeSelected(DateTimeOffset selectedTime) { }

    // drag/drop - all three are default interface methods, so existing providers still compile
    public bool CanChangeEvent(SchedulerEvent evt) => true;                    // defaults to false
    public bool CanChangeEventTo(SchedulerEventChange change) => true;
    public async Task<bool> OnEventChanged(SchedulerEventChange change) { ... } // defaults to false
}
```

`CanChangeEvent` defaults to `false`, so a provider that ignores drag/drop can never have its events moved even if an app sets `AllowEventDrag` - the opt-in is required on both the view and the provider. `SchedulerEventChange` carries the event, its original `Start`/`End`, the proposed (already snapped) `NewStart`/`NewEnd`, and a `Kind` of `Move` / `ResizeStart` / `ResizeEnd`. Returning `false` from `OnEventChanged` reverts; throwing reverts and raises `EventChangeFailed` on the view.

On Blazor, events are matched across the JS boundary by `SchedulerEvent.Identifier` (a `Guid` by default) - duplicate identifiers make a drag a no-op rather than move the wrong event. Blazor also has `DragValidationMode`: `OnCommit` (default, no interop while the pointer moves) or `PerPosition` (`CanChangeEventTo` per snap boundary, which is visibly slower on WASM).
