/// <summary>
/// One button in a <see cref="ModalView"/>'s footer, rendered as a <see cref="ShinyButton"/> so it
/// picks up the active theme.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The footer is the part of a modal that is nearly always the same shape - a row of actions on the
/// right, cancel first - so it is a list rather than markup. Reach for
/// <see cref="ModalView.FooterTemplate"/> when the footer is doing something else entirely.
/// <para>
/// Mutating a button in place (its <see cref="State"/>, say) does not repaint on its own; the modal
/// re-renders when the click handler that changed it returns, and any other change wants a
/// <c>StateHasChanged</c>.

/// <code>
/// Buttons =
/// [
///     new ModalButton("Cancel") { Appearance = ButtonAppearance.Text, Type = ButtonType.Secondary },
///     new ModalButton("Save") { ClosesModal = false, OnClick = SaveAsync }
