/// The native touch plumbing a view needs to start a drag from inside a scroller.

/// <remarks>
/// Two problems, one hook.
///
/// (1) A <see cref="PanGestureRecognizer"/> nested in a <see cref="ScrollView"/> is not reliably
/// delivered. Android's scroller takes the gesture away from its children the moment the touch
/// crosses the touch slop, and <c>ScrollOrientation.Neither</c> does not help because MauiScrollView
/// only tests it in OnTouchEvent, never in OnInterceptTouchEvent. UIScrollView cancels the touches
/// it has already delivered to a child as soon as its own pan recognizer begins. Either way the pan
/// dies mid-gesture - or never starts at all.
///
/// (2) A pan cannot time a long press. It does not start until the finger has already moved, so
/// "hold still, then drag" has to be measured from the raw touch-down instead.
///
/// <see cref="DragSortRow"/> solves the first half the same way for TableView's row reorder.
